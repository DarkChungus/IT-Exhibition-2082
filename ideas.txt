- chaos theory(lorenz attractor, van der pol oscillator, predictability horizon, use in solar system predictions and weather forecasts, ocean currents)
- newton-raphson method
- black hole orbits?
- show how integration works i guess
- prime distribution: prime number theorem(compare Ï€(n) with n/log(n) and Li(n)), prime gaps, riemann hypothesis ðŸ‘…, prime spirals(using quadratics like euler)
- laplace transform
